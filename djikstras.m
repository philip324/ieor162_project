function route = djikstra(start_node, end_node, map)
%takes a cell containing  nodes and costs and returns the shortest
%path between a start and end node in the set

%load the cell from the above function


%run djikstra's algorithm from the start node to the end node

%return the resulting shortest path as an array where each entry is the
%node traversed
