function costs = edgeCosts(map)
%takes a set of nodes and maps out the paths between them


%start by mapping out where the vertices are


%then figure out what transportation methods exist between the start_node
%and end node


%then calculate the distance between each vertex


%then calculate the cost of travelling that distance


%repeat this for every edge in the network


%return a cell containing start, end, cost for each pair
